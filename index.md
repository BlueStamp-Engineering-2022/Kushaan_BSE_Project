# Bicycle Turn Signal Jacket
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up a smaller scale version of my circuit. My system had 1 battery pack and two LEDs. These LEDs signified the the left and right turn signals of the jacket. The circuit uses an arduio lilypad which is and arduino made specifically for wearable technology.

My starter project was the TV-Be-Gone. It was really fun learning how to solder. I learned that flux is really hard to get off a board.
